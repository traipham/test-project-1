# Pre-work - _Memory Game_

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program.

Submitted by: Trai Pham

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with https://glitch.com...)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
- [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked.
- [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.
- [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
- [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.
- [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
- [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
- [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
- [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
- [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
- [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
- [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
- [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
- [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
- [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   Stack Overflow: I was trying to find a way to get a global variable from a javascript file to an html file. 
   W3schools: I used this to further understand javascript, html, and css
   Codecademy: used for comprehension of javascript code.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   I believe that a challenge I've encountered creating this submission was being able to visualize what the given code is trying to do. I have little to none web developing skills, but I 
   am trying my best to fully grasp the coding syntax of the languages required for creating this game. To help me understand these codes and visualize what it does, I used Stack Overflow and the internet 
   as a guide. The little hints and elaboration within the prework.md really expanded my understanding of the codes. In addition, I tried my best 
   to replicate the code, but at the same time put my own style/spin on it. I didn't wanted to rely entirely on the code, and if I did
    I tried to apply my own knowledge on how to recreate the given code. I used my notes and what I've learned from Codecademy to help me think of different ways
    too apply the code. I'm not as adapted to javascript, html, and css, though I've worked with it on a few 
   workshops for UCSD. As a result, I found myself looking back at some notes for javascript that I've written up based on a course from Codecademy just to stir up any hidden knowledge.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
  How would I get started on learning web development? I understand that just following a course on YouTube, or on some teaching course 
   would help boost my knowledge for web developing. I want to know in your opinion what is the best way. (e.g. Codecademy) Are JavaScript, HTML, and CSS the main coding language used in web development? 
   How would I further enhance my web pages? What tools/programs do you use for web developing? What are some good habits for web developing? How does web development impact society and the economy?
   What do industries/businesses look for in a web developer? 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would probably add different difficulties that players could select. This could be done by tweaking
   the UI and giving players an option to choose what difficulty they would want to play. I would want to add an additional level counter that would be updated every round that 
   the player gets a right answer. I would add little comments after every round so that players would feel encouraged and enjoy their time a bit more playing the game. Additionally, I would want to implement a way
   for players to save their progress, if they wanted to stop and take a break. Though that might defeat the purpose of a memory game, because players could abuse the save system. Instead of using the regular JavaScript
   sound implementation, I would like to put in my own custom sound.
